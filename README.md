## About ðŸ“Œ

The goal of this project is to develop a `client`-`server` communication program using UNIX signals only.

### Mandatory Features

The mandatory implementation must behave as follows:

* First the `server` must be started, which will generate a `pid` and print it to `stdout`.
* The `client` should accept two parameters:
	* The `pid` of the `server`;
	* The `message` to be sent;
* The `client` must send the `message` passed in as a parameter to the `server`.
* Upon receiving the `message` the `server` must print it to `stdout` almost instantly.
* The `server` must be able to receive `message`s from several different clients in a row without the need for a restart. (Note that Linux systems do NOT queue signals when a signal of the same type is already pending).
* `client`-`server` communication must be done using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals only.

### Bonus Features

* The `server` acknowledges receiving a message by sending back a signal to the `client`.
* Must support Unicode characters.
